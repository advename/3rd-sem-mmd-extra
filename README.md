# 3rd Semester Front End Extra Curriculum

These files should be used to demonstrate particular cases of webdev security.
They are based on [this presentation](https://goo.gl/CziJMY).

## 1. Test password against a password list

Demonstration how easy it is to find somebody's password in a [list of the "only 10.000 most used passwords"](https://github.com/advename/3rd-sem-mmd-extra/blob/master/Password/password-list.json).

## 2. Page password protect

## 4. Frontend with Backend example using Firebase

This example should demonstrate to the frontend developer what actually happens in the backend and how users are authenticated. This should not replace a whole fullstack setup but serves just as a better understanding of a webdev project.
